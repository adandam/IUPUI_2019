Impact of medication use on pregnancy outcomes.
It is estimated that over half of women receive a prescription or nonprescription medication
during pregnancy. Though some medications are known to cause birth defects or adverse
pregnancy outcomes, which may lead to under prescribing for pregnant women and women of
childbearing age. The number of drugs taken by pregnant women is increasing which may lead
to increased birth defects. One cause of adverse pregnancy outcomes is adverse drug reactions or
drug interactions and no proper alert system in prescribing the combinations of drugs to pregnant
women. The aim of the study is to evaluate the impact of medication use on adverse pregnancy
outcomes, such as stillbirth, preterm birth, and small for gestational age at delivery. This study
aims to identify drugs that lead to adverse pregnancy outcomes and helps in further research to
identify the root cause. The data used for this analysis is from the Numom2B study, a
prospective cross-sectional study of 10,000 nulliparous women. For this analysis, we are
focusing on 326 variables including medications used in pregnancy, demographic variables, and
outcomes of life vs. stillbirth, small for gestational age, and preterm birth. The dependent
variables are the pregnancy outcomes and independent variables are the medications prescribed.
Data cleaning was performed to normalize drug names to third level hierarchy ATC codes.
Machine learning models like logistic, random forest and CART were performed to predict the
outcomes with an accuracy of 93.5%, 86.7%, and 62% respectively. We found that the number
of drugs taken by women does not impact on the pregnancy outcomes. Specific classes of drugs,
including anti-hypertensive, anti-diabetic, antidepressants were correlated with adverse
pregnancy outcomes.
