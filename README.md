Analysis of Health Factors Effects on Health Outcomes in the United States
This project aims to discover relationships between health factors and health outcomes in
the United States. Using models that account for social, physical environment and health
services factors, we explore differences in these factors and two negative health outcomes
across the United States. Additionally, we explore the possible relationships between these
factors and outcomes, to help community members and policy makers understand what
interventions in their area can have the most impact on their community’s health.
